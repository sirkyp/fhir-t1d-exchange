# Project Context
- You are an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide expert. 
- You are an expert in the T1D Exchange: https://t1dexchange.org/making-diabetes-electronic-medical-record-data-actionable-promoting-benchmarking-and-population-health-improvement-using-the-t1d-exchange-quality-improvement-portal/

## Project Overview
- Create an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for the T1D Exchange Data Specification.
- This guide facilitates the exchange of health information related to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare systems and applications.
- The IG supports the T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative's mission to improve diabetes care through standardized data exchange and benchmarking.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- **Core Profiles**: All major FHIR profiles implemented (Patient, Provider, Organization, Encounter, Observation variants, Condition, Medication)
- **Bundle Profiles**: Three bundle patterns for batch data sharing (T1DDataSubmissionBundle, T1DPatientDataBundle, T1DQualityReportBundle)
- **Operations**: Data submission and patient extraction operations ($submit-t1d-data, $extract-patient-data)
- **Terminology**: Custom CodeSystems and ValueSets for T1D-specific concepts
- **Examples**: Complete example instances for all profiles and bundle patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guidance, bundle patterns, mapping documentation, and CGM IG comparison
- **Build System**: Functional SUSHI/FSH build pipeline with error resolution
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal dependencies - using base FHIR R4 resources

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Base FHIR Approach**: Profiles inherit from base FHIR R4 resources rather than US Core to avoid slicing complexity
- **Bundle-Centric Design**: Adopted CGM IG bundle patterns for batch data sharing optimized for quality improvement workflows
- **Modular Design**: Separate observation profiles for different measurement types (glucose, HbA1c, SDOH)
- **Flexible Terminology**: Custom terminologies with external standard bindings where appropriate
- **Quality Focus**: Integration of T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative context

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create an IG based on the specifications found in the ./t1d-exchange-specs folder
- ✅ Review specs and identify appropriate FHIR resource mappings
- ✅ Define FHIR Profiles with rules and guidelines for data structure
- ✅ Provide comprehensive guidance for developers
- ✅ Create CodeSystem and ValueSet resources for T1D-specific terminologies
- ✅ Document mapping from spec data elements to IG resources
- ✅ Ensure HL7 FHIR R4 compliance
- ✅ Include examples for each profile
- ✅ Validate IG and resolve build errors
- ✅ CGM Implementation Guide comparison and alignment analysis
- ✅ Bundle patterns for batch data sharing (based on CGM IG approach)
- ✅ Operations for data submission and patient extraction
- ✅ T1D Variable-to-FHIR mapping documentation
- ✅ Quality Improvement Collaborative context integration
- ✅ Must Support refinement based on T1D Exchange specification mappings

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Use Sushi/FSH for profile definition
- ✅ Use FHIR R4 (4.0.1)
- ✅ Minimal dependencies approach

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Base FHIR R4 dependency
- ✅ IG Publisher integration for local builds
- ✅ SUSHI build pipeline with npm scripts

## Constraints
- **Dependency Minimization**: Avoid complex dependencies like US Core to reduce slicing conflicts
- **T1D Focus**: Maintain specific focus on Type 1 Diabetes rather than general diabetes care
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensure compatibility with existing FHIR ecosystems

## Assumptions (VALIDATED)
- ✅ The data elements required are fully described in the t1d-exchange-specs
- ✅ Base FHIR resources provide sufficient foundation
- ✅ T1D Exchange collaborative context enhances implementation value

## Success Criteria (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ All data elements in specs mapped to distinct FHIR elements
- ✅ Comprehensive guidance documentation for developers
- ✅ IG builds successfully and is error-free
- ✅ All terminology codes and displays are active and correct
- ✅ Complete example coverage for all profiles
- ✅ Variable mapping documentation provides clear implementation path

## Current Status
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean builds with no errors
- **Profile Coverage**: ✅ Complete (8 core profiles + 3 bundle profiles)
- **Operations**: ✅ Complete (2 operations for data exchange)
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive (7 documentation pages including bundle patterns)
- **Examples**: ✅ Complete coverage including bundle examples
- **Terminology**: ✅ Custom terminologies implemented
- **Must Support**: ✅ Refined based on T1D Exchange specification mappings

## Enhanced Profile Documentation Requirements
- **Element Definitions**: Map full content from specification "Definition" column to StructureDefinition element.definition
- **Element Short Descriptions**: Create 5-10 word summaries from Definition column for element.short
- **Element Comments**: Combine "Data Mapping Priority"/"Data" column + "Notes" column + other contextual columns into element.comment
- **Specification Traceability**: Maintain clear mapping from T1D Exchange specification variables to FHIR elements

## Out of Scope
- US Core Profile dependencies
- Non-T1D diabetes conditions and treatments
- Real-time data streaming (focus on data exchange standards)
- Implementation-specific technical details beyond FHIR standards
