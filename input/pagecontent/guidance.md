# Implementation Guidance

## Overview

This page provides detailed guidance for implementing the T1D Exchange FHIR Implementation Guide. It covers data mapping, technical requirements, and best practices for successful implementation.

## T1D Exchange Background

The T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) is a research initiative focused on improving care for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes through standardized data collection and quality improvement efforts. This FHIR Implementation Guide supports the T1D Exchange mission by:

- **Standardizing Data Exchange**: Enabling consistent data sharing between healthcare systems, research institutions, and quality improvement programs
- **Supporting Quality Metrics**: Facilitating the collection of key performance indicators for T1D care quality assessment
- **Enabling Population Health**: Supporting population-level analysis and benchmarking for T1D care improvement
- **Research Integration**: Providing a framework for clinical research data collection and analysis

### Key Quality Improvement Focus Areas

The T1D Exchange collaborative focuses on several critical areas of T1D care:

1. **Glycemic Control**: HbA1c monitoring and glucose management optimization
2. **Technology Adoption**: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump utilization
3. **Care Transitions**: Pediatric to adult care transition planning and execution
4. **Social Determinants**: Understanding and addressing barriers to optimal T1D care
5. **Family Engagement**: Supporting family involvement in T1D management

This Implementation Guide directly supports these focus areas through structured data collection and standardized reporting mechanisms.

## Data Mapping

### Core Data Specifications Mapping

The T1D Exchange data specifications define several core data files that map to FHIR resources as follows:

| Specification File | FHIR Resource | Profile |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Patients | Patient | T1DPatient |
| Providers | Practitioner, Organization | T1DProvider, T1DOrganization |
| Encounters | Encounter | T1DEncounter |
| Observations | Observation | T1DObservation, T1DGlucoseObservation, T1DHbA1cObservation, T1DSDOHObservation |
| Conditions | Condition, FamilyMemberHistory | T1DCondition, T1DFamilyHistory |
| Medications | MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement | T1DMedicationRequest, T1DMedicationStatement |

### Diabetes-Specific Data Mapping

The diabetes-specific data elements map to specialized observation profiles:

| Data Category | FHIR Profile | Key Elements |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Disease | T1DCondition | T1D diagnosis date, transition plan |
| Insulin | T1DMedicationRequest | Insulin regimen, delivery method |
| Monitoring | T1DObservation | BGM/CGM device information |
| Glucose | T1DGlucoseObservation | BGM mean, CGM metrics, time in range |

## Implementation Requirements

### Must Support Elements

All elements marked as "Must Support" (MS) in the profiles must be supported by implementing systems. This means:

- **Sender**: Must be capable of sending the element if data is available
- **Receiver**: Must be capable of receiving and processing the element
- **Storage**: Must store the element for future retrieval

### Identifier Requirements

Each profile requires specific identifiers:

- **T1DPatient**: Must include T1D-ID, may include MRN
- **T1DProvider**: Must include T1D-PROVIDER-ID, may include NPI
- **T1DOrganization**: Must include T1D-ORG-ID
- **T1DEncounter**: Must include T1D-ENCOUNTER-ID

### Data Quality Guidelines

### Research and Quality Improvement Context

Data collected through this Implementation Guide supports both clinical care and research objectives. Quality data collection is essential for:

- **Benchmarking**: Comparing care quality across different healthcare systems and providers
- **Outcome Analysis**: Tracking patient outcomes and identifying improvement opportunities
- **Population Health**: Understanding T1D care patterns and disparities at scale
- **Clinical Research**: Supporting evidence-based improvements in T1D care protocols

### Data Collection Standards

#### Date Formats
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
- Include time zones for dateTime elements
- Support partial dates (YYYY-MM or YYYY) where specified
- **Research Note**: Consistent date formatting is critical for longitudinal analysis and care transition tracking

#### Coding Requirements
- Use specified value sets for coded elements
- Include both code and display values
- Support multiple coding systems where applicable
- **Quality Note**: Standardized coding enables accurate aggregation and comparison across participating sites

#### Units of Measure
- Use UCUM codes for all quantities
- Convert glucose values to mg/dL (multiply mmol/L by 18)
- Round glucose means to nearest integer
- **Clinical Note**: Consistent units support accurate clinical decision-making and quality metric calculation

- **HbA1c > 9%**: Percentage of patients with suboptimal glycemic control
- **Time in Range**: CGM-derived metric for glucose control (70-180 mg/dL)
- **Glucose Management Indicator (GMI)**: CGM-derived HbA1c equivalent

#### Technology Utilization Metrics
- **CGM Usage**: Percentage of patients using continuous glucose monitoring
- **Insulin Pump Usage**: Percentage of patients using insulin pump therapy
- **Automated Insulin Delivery**: Percentage using hybrid closed-loop systems

#### Care Process Metrics
- **Visit Frequency**: Number of diabetes care visits per year
- **Transition Planning**: Percentage of adolescents with documented transition plans
- **SDOH Screening**: Percentage of patients screened for social determinants of health

#### Implementation Note
These metrics are automatically calculable from data collected using the profiles in this IG, supporting both individual patient care and population health analysis.

## Implementation Patterns

### Bundle-Based Data Sharing

The T1D Exchange IG adopts a bundle-centric approach optimized for batch data sharing scenarios common in diabetes care quality improvement initiatives.

#### T1D Data Submission Bundle

Use the `T1DDataSubmissionBundle` profile for submitting comprehensive T1D data:

```http
POST [base]/Bundle/$submit-t1d-data
Content-Type: application/fhir+json

{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "meta": {
    "profile": ["http://t1dexchange.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/t1d-data-submission-bundle"]
  },
  "type": "transaction",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:patient-001",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "meta": {
          "profile": ["http://t1dexchange.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/t1d-patient"]
        }
      },
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "Patient",
        "ifNoneExist": "identifier=http://t1dexchange.org/patient-id|T1D-001"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Patient Data Extraction

Extract comprehensive patient data using the patient data bundle:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/[id]/$extract-patient-data?start=2023-01-01&end=2023-12-31
```

Returns a `T1DPatientDataBundle` containing all relevant T1D data for the patient.
