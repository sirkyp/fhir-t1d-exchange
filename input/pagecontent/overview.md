### Overview

This page provides an overview of implementing the T1D Exchange FHIR Implementation Guide and links to detailed implementation guidance.

### T1D Exchange Background

The T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) is a research initiative focused on improving care for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes through standardized data collection and quality improvement efforts. This FHIR Implementation Guide supports the T1D Exchange mission by:

- **Standardizing Data Exchange**: Enabling consistent data sharing between healthcare systems, research institutions, and quality improvement programs
- **Supporting Quality Metrics**: Facilitating the collection of key performance indicators for T1D care quality assessment
- **Enabling Population Health**: Supporting population-level analysis and benchmarking for T1D care improvement
- **Research Integration**: Providing a framework for clinical research data collection and analysis

#### Key Quality Improvement Focus Areas

The T1D Exchange collaborative focuses on several critical areas of T1D care:

1. **Glycemic Control**: HbA1c monitoring and glucose management optimization
2. **Technology Adoption**: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump utilization
3. **Care Transitions**: Pediatric to adult care transition planning and execution
4. **Social Determinants**: Understanding and addressing barriers to optimal T1D care
5. **Family Engagement**: Supporting family involvement in T1D management

This Implementation Guide directly supports these focus areas through structured data collection and standardized reporting mechanisms.

### Data Mapping

#### Core Data Specifications Mapping

The T1D Exchange data specifications define several core data files that map to FHIR resources as follows:

| Specification File | FHIR Resource | Profile |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Patients | Patient | T1DPatient |
| Providers | Practitioner, Organization | T1DProvider, T1DOrganization |
| Encounters | Encounter | T1DEncounter |
| Observations | Observation | T1DObservation, T1DGlucoseObservation, T1DHbA1cObservation, T1DSDOHObservation |
| Conditions | Condition, FamilyMemberHistory | T1DCondition, T1DFamilyHistory |
| Medications | MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement | T1DMedicationRequest, T1DMedicationStatement |

#### Diabetes-Specific Data Mapping

The diabetes-specific data elements map to specialized observation profiles:

| Data Category | FHIR Profile | Key Elements |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Disease | T1DCondition | T1D diagnosis date, transition plan |
| Insulin | T1DMedicationRequest | Insulin regimen, delivery method |
| Monitoring | T1DObservation | BGM/CGM device information |
| Glucose | T1DGlucoseObservation | BGM mean, CGM metrics, time in range |

For detailed variable-to-FHIR element mappings, see the [Variable Mapping](mapping.html) page.
