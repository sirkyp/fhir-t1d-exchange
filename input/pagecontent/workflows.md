### Implementation Patterns and Workflows

This page describes implementation patterns and data exchange workflows for the T1D Exchange IG.

### Bundle-Based Data Sharing

The T1D Exchange IG adopts a bundle-centric approach optimized for batch data sharing scenarios common in diabetes care quality improvement initiatives.

#### T1D Data Submission Bundle

Use the `T1DDataSubmissionBundle` profile for submitting comprehensive T1D data:

```http
POST [base]/Bundle/$submit-t1d-data
Content-Type: application/fhir+json

{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "meta": {
    "profile": ["http://t1dexchange.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/t1d-data-submission-bundle"]
  },
  "type": "transaction",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:patient-001",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "meta": {
          "profile": ["http://t1dexchange.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/t1d-patient"]
        }
      },
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "Patient",
        "ifNoneExist": "identifier=http://t1dexchange.org/patient-id|T1D-001"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Patient Data Extraction

Extract comprehensive patient data using the patient data bundle:

```http
GET [base]/Patient/[id]/$extract-patient-data?start=2023-01-01&end=2023-12-31
```

Returns a `T1DPatientDataBundle` containing all relevant T1D data for the patient.

#### Quality Reporting

Use `T1DQualityReportBundle` for population health reporting with aggregate measures and benchmarking data.

### Data Exchange Workflows

#### Batch Data Submission Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect T1D data from EHR systems or registries
2. **Bundle Assembly**: Create T1DDataSubmissionBundle with all resource types
3. **Submission**: POST bundle to `$submit-t1d-data` operation
4. **Response Processing**: Handle transaction-response bundle with status codes

#### Patient Data Extraction Workflow

1. **Request**: Call `$extract-patient-data` operation with date range
2. **Processing**: Server assembles comprehensive patient data
3. **Response**: Receive T1DPatientDataBundle with all relevant resources
4. **Analysis**: Use extracted data for care coordination or research

#### Quality Reporting Workflow

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect population-level T1D metrics
2. **Report Generation**: Create T1DQualityReportBundle
3. **Benchmarking**: Compare against T1D Exchange quality benchmarks
4. **Improvement Planning**: Use insights for care improvement initiatives

### Individual Resource Patterns

#### Patient Registration
1. Create T1DPatient resource with required identifiers
2. Include demographic extensions (race, ethnicity, education)
3. Link to T1DOrganization for care provider

#### Encounter Documentation
1. Create T1DEncounter with proper classification
2. Link to T1DPatient and T1DProvider
3. Include encounter-specific extensions

#### Observation Recording
1. Choose appropriate observation profile based on data type
2. Include proper categorization and coding
3. Link to encounter and performing provider

#### Medication Management
1. Use T1DMedicationRequest for prescriptions
2. Include insulin-specific extensions
3. Document delivery methods and regimens
