> **IMPLEMENTER NOTE**: This Implementation Guide is an early work in progress developed through human-AI collaboration. It requires expert review, testing, and validation before any production use. The profiles, terminology, and guidance should be considered draft and subject to significant revision based on clinical expert feedback and real-world testing.

### Implementation Patterns and Workflows

This page describes implementation patterns and data exchange workflows for the T1D Exchange IG.

### Bundle-Based Data Sharing

The T1D Exchange IG adopts a bundle-centric approach optimized for batch data sharing scenarios. For detailed bundle profiles, operations, and examples, see the [Bundle Patterns](bundles.html) page.

### Data Exchange Workflows

For detailed bundle-based workflows including batch data submission, patient data extraction, and quality reporting, see the [Bundle Patterns](bundles.html) page which covers:
- Complete workflow examples with step-by-step processes
- Bundle operations and response handling
- Use case scenarios for EHR integration, registry operations, and quality improvement

### Individual Resource Patterns

#### Patient Registration
1. Create [T1DPatient](StructureDefinition-t1d-patient.html) resource with required identifiers
2. Include demographic extensions as defined in [Technical Implementation](implementation.html)
3. Link to [T1DOrganization](StructureDefinition-t1d-organization.html) for care provider

#### Encounter Documentation
1. Create [T1DEncounter](StructureDefinition-t1d-encounter.html) with proper classification
2. Link to [T1DPatient](StructureDefinition-t1d-patient.html) and [T1DProvider](StructureDefinition-t1d-provider.html)
3. Include encounter-specific extensions

#### Observation Recording
1. Choose appropriate observation profile based on data type (see [Profiles](profiles.html))
2. Include proper categorization and coding per [Terminology](terminology.html)
3. Link to encounter and performing provider

#### Medication Management
1. Use [T1DMedicationRequest](StructureDefinition-t1d-medication-request.html) for prescriptions
2. Include insulin-specific extensions
3. Document delivery methods and regimens

### Use Case Examples

#### EHR Integration

Healthcare systems can integrate with T1D Exchange using these patterns:

1. **Daily Data Sync**: Submit daily T1D patient data using individual resource patterns
2. **Care Transitions**: Extract comprehensive patient data for referrals
3. **Quality Reporting**: Generate quarterly quality reports for benchmarking

#### Registry Operations

T1D registries can leverage individual resource patterns for:

1. **Patient Registration**: Register new T1D patients with complete demographics
2. **Clinical Data Collection**: Record encounters, observations, and medications
3. **Quality Measurement**: Generate population health reports

#### Quality Improvement Programs

Quality improvement initiatives can use individual resources for:

1. **Baseline Assessment**: Collect initial patient and clinical data
2. **Intervention Tracking**: Monitor improvement interventions
3. **Outcome Measurement**: Report quality improvement results
