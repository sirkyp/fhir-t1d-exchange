### Introduction

The T1D Exchange Implementation Guide (IG) provides a standardized approach for exchanging health information related to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management. This guide facilitates interoperability between different healthcare systems and applications by defining FHIR profiles, extensions, and terminology specific to T1D care.

### Background

The T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) is a multi-site research initiative focused on improving outcomes for people with Type 1 diabetes through standardized data collection, analysis, and quality improvement efforts. This implementation guide supports the T1D Exchange mission by enabling:

#### Core Capabilities
- Standardized FHIR profiles for T1D-specific data elements
- Extensions for capturing T1D-specific information not covered by base FHIR resources
- Terminology and value sets for consistent coding
- Implementation guidance for developers and healthcare organizations

#### Quality Improvement Support
- **Benchmarking**: Enable comparison of care quality across healthcare systems
- **Population Health**: Support aggregate analysis for T1D care improvement
- **Research Integration**: Facilitate clinical research data collection and analysis
- **Quality Metrics**: Automated calculation of key T1D care performance indicators

### Scope

This implementation guide covers the following areas of T1D care:

- **Patient Demographics**: Including T1D-specific demographic information such as education level, race, and ethnicity
- **Provider Information**: Healthcare professionals and organizations involved in T1D care
- **Encounters**: Clinical interactions between patients and healthcare providers
- **Observations**: Laboratory results, vital signs, and T1D-specific measurements including glucose monitoring and HbA1c
- **Conditions**: T1D diagnosis, complications, and related conditions
- **Medications**: Insulin therapy, delivery methods, and other T1D-related medications
- **Social Determinants of Health**: Transportation and housing security factors affecting T1D management

### Key Features

- **FHIR R4 Compliance**: All profiles are based on FHIR R4 (4.0.1) specifications
- **T1D-Specific Extensions**: Custom extensions for T1D-specific data elements
- **Comprehensive Terminology**: Code systems and value sets for T1D-related concepts
- **Quality-Focused Design**: Supports T1D Exchange quality improvement metrics
- **Research-Ready**: Structured for clinical research and population health analysis
- **Implementation Examples**: Sample instances demonstrating proper usage
