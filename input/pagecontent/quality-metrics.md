> **IMPLEMENTER NOTE**: This Implementation Guide is an early work in progress developed through human-AI collaboration. It requires expert review, testing, and validation before any production use. The profiles, terminology, and guidance should be considered draft and subject to significant revision based on clinical expert feedback and real-world testing.

### T1D Exchange Quality Metrics

This page describes the quality indicators and metrics supported by the T1D Exchange Implementation Guide.

### Core T1D Quality Indicators

This Implementation Guide supports collection of key quality metrics identified by the T1D Exchange collaborative:

#### Glycemic Control Metrics
- **HbA1c < 7%**: Percentage of patients achieving target glycemic control
- **HbA1c > 9%**: Percentage of patients with suboptimal glycemic control
- **Time in Range**: CGM-derived metric for glucose control (70-180 mg/dL)
- **Glucose Management Indicator (GMI)**: CGM-derived HbA1c equivalent

#### Technology Utilization Metrics
- **CGM Usage**: Percentage of patients using continuous glucose monitoring
- **Insulin Pump Usage**: Percentage of patients using insulin pump therapy
- **Automated Insulin Delivery**: Percentage using hybrid closed-loop systems

#### Care Process Metrics
- **Visit Frequency**: Number of diabetes care visits per year
- **Transition Planning**: Percentage of adolescents with documented transition plans
- **SDOH Screening**: Percentage of patients screened for social determinants of health

#### Implementation Note
These metrics are automatically calculable from data collected using the profiles in this IG, supporting both individual patient care and population health analysis.
